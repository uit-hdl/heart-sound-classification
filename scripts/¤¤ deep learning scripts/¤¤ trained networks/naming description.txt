CV = cross validation. The variable then contains a cell array of
networks, where the network of cell i corresponds to the i:th CV-split.

'noNoise' means that only non-noisy recordings were used for network
training.

'aa' refers to position used for training. If not indicated, or if
'allPos', then all positions have been used.

'DrOut' implies that dropout has been used during training.

geq = 'greater than or equal to'. Indicates the cutoff severity grade
used to define the positive class.

AR/MR = aortic/mitral regurgitation.

MurG = murmur grade. MurG2 --> murmur-grade>=2 is target class.

Reg = regression. Target treated as continuous variable.

ValStop --> validation set error was used to stop training. If followed
by 'Overtrain', then 5 additional epochs were finnished after the
validation set stoppage criteria was reached.

'nameNetwork'_1234 indicates that networks have been trained only
for CV-splits 1 to 4.

...TrainingSet... --> network trained on entire training/developement
set. These networks are used to on the test/holdout set.
